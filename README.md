My first open source project is [fxamacker/cbor](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor).  It's used in modern blockchain-related  projects (Chainlink, Flow, Gnark, Oasis), secure messaging systems (Katzenpost), IoT (EdgeX Foundry), and more.

I used Go to create fxamacker/cbor but I've used other languages extensively (especially C++) in closed source software. I chose Go because it saved us a lot of time on a multi-language project.  As a bonus, using Go felt like taking a vacation compared to multithreaded C++ programming.  I miss generics and fast FFI to C functions but I love the fast builds and easy concurrency of Go.

If you use fxamacker/cbor in your project, please let me know.  I'm curious to see where and how it's used.  Thanks!

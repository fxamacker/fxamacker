My first open source project is [fxamacker/cbor](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor).  It's a [CBOR codec](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#cbor-codec-in-go) used by Arm Ltd., Berlin Institute of Health at Charit√©, Chainlink, ConsenSys, Dapper Labs, Duo Labs (cisco), EdgeX Foundry, Mozilla, Oasis Labs, and more.  

I tried to balance competing factors such as speed, size, safety, usability, and maintainability.  If you use fxamacker/cbor in your project, please let me know.  I'm curious to see where and how it's used!

I used Go to create fxamacker/cbor but I've used other languages extensively (especially C++) in closed source software. I chose Go because it boosted productivity on a successful choose-your-language(s) full-stack project for a large customer.  With Go, I spent more time creating software and less time debugging compared to multithreaded C++ programming.  I miss generics and fast FFI to C functions but I love the fast builds, easier concurrency, and increased productivity with Go.

I'm looking forward to trying Zig when it nears release 1.0.  Looks like Zig can be to C what Rust might be to C++.

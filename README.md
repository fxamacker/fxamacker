My first open source project is [fxamacker/cbor](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor). It's a [CBOR codec](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor#cbor-codec-in-go) used by Arm Ltd., Berlin Institute of Health at Charit√©, Chainlink, ConsenSys, Dapper Labs, Duo Labs (cisco), EdgeX Foundry, Mozilla, Oasis Labs, Netherlands (govt), Taurus SA, and others.

Other open source contributions include [onflow/atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree), [fxamacker/circlehash](https://github.com/fxamacker/circlehash),  sometimes [onflow/cadence](https://github.com/onflow/cadence), and others.

[Atree](https://github.com/onflow/atree) provides scalable arrays and maps. My design contributions include novel hash collision handling that combines non-cryptographic and cryptographic hashing for faster speed, reduced storage size, and security.  It's different from published designs such as double hashing, 2-choice hashing, cuckoo hashing, hopscotch hashing, etc.

[CircleHash](https://github.com/fxamacker/circlehash) is a family of fast non-cryptographic hash functions I created.  CircleHash64 and CircleHash64fx don't exceed 0.8% worst-bit error in [Strict Avalanche Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect#Strict_avalanche_criterion) for 0-128 byte inputs (using demerphq/smhasher modified to test more sizes).

I try to balance competing factors such as speed, simplicity, security, usability, and maintainability based on each project's priorities.

I've been using Go but used other languages extensively (especially C++). I chose Go because it boosted productivity on successful choose-your-language(s) full-stack projects.  With Go, I spent more time creating software and less time debugging compared to multithreaded C++ programming. I miss generics and fast FFI to C functions but I love Go's faster builds, easier concurrency, and increased productivity with Go.  Looking forward to Go 1.18 having generics.

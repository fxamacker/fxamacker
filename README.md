I create secure and reliable software. My first open source project is [fxamacker/cbor](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor).  It's used in modern blockchain-related  projects (Chainlink, Flow, Oasis), secure messaging systems (Katzenpost), IoT (EdgeX Foundry), and more.

I used Go to create fxamacker/cbor but I've used other languages extensively (especially C++) in closed source software. I chose Go because it saved us a lot of time on a multi-language project.  As a bonus, using Go felt like taking a vacation compared to multithreaded C++ programming.  I miss generics and fast FFI to C functions but I love the fast builds and easy concurrency of Go.

My experience includes conceiving, designing, implementing, maintaining, and testing enterprise data security software that was successfully licensed and deployed across the US (it wasn't approved for export).  A customer with 3,000+ employees chose and deployed our solution after a weeks-long evaluation against flagship  enterprise solutions offered by well-funded competitors because our solution was the only one that prevented all theft scenarios the customer tried (including bad actors logged in as Windows Administrator).

âš¡ Fun facts: I used a desktop running Qubes OS while creating fxamacker/cbor.  And I prefer stream ciphers over block ciphers.

If you use fxamacker/cbor in your project, please let me know.  I'm curious to see where and how it's used.  Thanks!
